# Code of Conduct

## Purpose
The **Open Science 101** community is committed to preserve and foster a diverse, safe, and welcoming community, to include the largest number of participants possible. The following Code of Conduct applies to our repos, mailing lists, website content, and any other **Open Science 101**-supported communication group, as well as any private communication initiated in the context of these spaces. 

We expect all **Open Science 101** community contributors to abide by this Code of Conduct. This applies to all online and in-person community events, as well as in all one-on-one communications regarding community matters. Help to create a safe and positive experience for everyone.

Simply put, community discussions should be

* respectful and kind;
* about **Open Science 101**;
* about features and material, not the individuals involved.

## Be respectful and constructive.
Treat everyone with respect. Build on each other's ideas. Each of us has the right to enjoy our experience and participate without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or subtle. Remember that you may not be communicating with someone in their primary language and from a different cultural background. We all get frustrated when working on hard problems, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into personal attacks.

Always **choose collaboration instead of conflict**.

## Speak up if you see or hear something.
You are empowered to politely engage when you feel that you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing - politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged.

If you are uncomfortable speaking up, or feel that your concerns are not being duly considered, you can contact a community organizer directly to resolve the issue. All concerns shared with community managers will be kept confidential. In cases where a public response is deemed necessary, the identities of victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

While all reports will be taken seriously, the community organizer may not act on complaints that they feel are not violations of this code of conduct.

For reports or discussion contact any of the team organizers directly and in confidence:

* [Matthias Fromm](https://github.com/matthiasfromm)
* [Konrad Förstner](https://github.com/konrad)
* [Andreas Leimbach](https://github.com/aleimba)

## We will not tolerate harassment of any kind, including but not limited to:
* Harassing or insulting comments
* Intimidation
* Encouraging a person to engage in self-harm
* Sustained disruption or derailing of threads, channels, lists, community events (like talks and presentations) etc.
* Violence, offensive or violent comments, jokes or otherwise
* Any racist, sexist, transphobic, homophobic, ableist or any other discriminatory jokes and language
* Inappropriate sexual or violent content
* Inappropriate physical contact. You need to have the other person's consent before touching them.
* Unwelcome sexual or otherwise aggressive attention (including comments or jokes, but also inadequate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances)
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in-person)
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Distribution or threat of distribution of people's personally identifying information (AKA “doxing”)
* Advocating for, or tolerating or encouraging, any of the above behavior

## Consequences for failing to comply with this policy
Consequences for failing to comply with this policy may include, at the sole discretion of the **Open Science 101** community organizers:

* a request for an apology;
* a private or public warning or reprimand;
* a temporary ban from any **Open Science 101**-supported community events and communication channels, including loss of committer status;
* a permanent ban from any of the above, or from all current and future **Open Science 101**-supported communities, including loss of committer status.

Participants warned to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately; failure to do so will result in an escalation of consequences. The decisions of the **Open Science 101** community organizers may be appealed with the **Open Science 101** team with a concise description of your grievance, if you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct.
