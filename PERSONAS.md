## Users

### Ida (lecturer)

Ida is a researcher in life science working on fruit fly
genetics. Since several years she has been part of the Open Science
community and is very active there. Besides that she like modern art,
Jazz music and tries to get into soldering in her local hack space.

She would like to teach an Open Science class but she knows
establishing such a course from scratch requires a lot of work which
she cannot squeez into her tight schedule. Ida searches the web for
potential material and find the Open Science 101. As this reduces the
preparation effort for her dramatically she desides to offer a class
"Introduction into Open Science". After each lecture given she reports
back to the Open Science 101 team and points to points that are
missing or that needs improvements.

### Nick (student)

Nick is a student of Physics and will soon start his Master in
semi-conductor quantum mechanics. When talking to PhD student during
an intership he heard about problems in the current way science is
conducted. He was informed that there is an Open Science movement that
would like to change how science is performed and he got interested in
learnig how he could perform his research.

Find a course about Open Science at this university that is given by
Ida. Ida invites the participants of the course to give feedback to
the Open Science 101 project. Nick generates and account on GitHub an
generates several issues where he suggest how the material could be
improved.

### Natalia (citizien scientist / interested lay person)

Natalia works as a lawyer at larger company. At some point she
recognized inspired by books of Carl Sagan she recognized how much fun
science and engineering can be. Due to this she started in her spare
time some small science projects on her own. 

On twitter she stumbles accross a link to the Open Science 101 project
and read the material of the different topics. Based on the newly
aquired knowledge she makes her small project open and connects to the
Open Science community by joining the OKFN Open Science mailing
list. Some months later she gives a lightning talk about Open Science
at maker fair in her town. She uses some graphics taken form the Open
Science 101 material. During that she spots a typo in the material and
writes an email to the maintainer of the material.
