## Collecting Ideas

As this project is currently in a preparation phase, the best starting point to contribute is to help us with collecting ideas and discussion them. Please feel invited to go over to the [issues section](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/issues) - you will find good starting points within the [milestones](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/milestones).

## Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016 (2nd - 3rd June, 2016)

At the upcoming Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016 -- an event with local and virtual meetings -- we will work on the compendium. Again, you are invited to join us (which you can announce here: https://github.com/mozillascience/global-sprint-2016/issues/36).

For the 2 days sprint we've created a [related milestone](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/milestones/Mozilla%20Science%20Global%20Sprint%202016) that contains the issues we want to want particularly concentrate on within the sprint - these are also good starting points if you want to join!

## Roadmap

Over time we will develop/extent a [roadmap](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/wiki/Roadmap) that provides a bit more oversight of what the current goals are and what the next goals will be.
