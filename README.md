# Open Science 101

## About

This compendium aims include documentation of the different facets of
Open Science like Open Access, Open Data, Open Source, Open Peer
Review. Our definition of Open Science is very broad - it also covers
the opening of the humanities as well as Open Educational Resources
and other related topics. "Open Science 101" is the current working
title and might be changed in the future dependent on the actual
content.

Currently we are collecting ideas about the scope via the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/issues) and
would **invite everybody to contribute** to the discussion and to
share ideas.

We are aware that this is not the first attempt to generate such a
collection but in our opinion there is no comprehensive resource
covering all the required topics.

The content of this collection is licensed under a [Creative Common
