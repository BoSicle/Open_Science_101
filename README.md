# Open Science 101

## About

This compendium aims to include documentation of the different facets of
Open Science like Open Access, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Peer
Review (see [Facettes of Open Science](https://github.com/aleimba/Facettes_of_Open_Science/blob/master/facettes_of_open_science.png)). Our definition of Open Science is very broad - it also covers
the opening of the humanities as well as Open Educational Resources
and other related topics. "Open Science 101" is the current working
title and might be changed in the future dependent on the actual
content.

Currently we are collecting ideas about the scope via the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/issues) and
would **invite everybody to contribute** to the discussion and to
share ideas.

Our role models for this repository are Software Carpentry (http://software-carpentry.org/)
and Data Carpentry (http://www.datacarpentry.org/). Both initiatives
host all their teaching material public in GitHub repositories so the
content can be easily crowd-sourced (see e.g. http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).
We will try to adhere to their style as far as this is suitable.

We are aware that this is not the first attempt to generate such a
collection but in our opinion there is no comprehensive resource
covering all the required topics.

with local and virtual meetings -- we will work on the
compendium. Again, you are invited to join us (which you can announce here:
