# Open Science 101 (working title)

## About

### General Problem

The principles and facets of open science have become increasingly
noted throughout the last couple of years. However, whereas Open
Access has gained quite a lot of visibility, other facets are hardly
visible and even less in action. Infact, many of the facets and
principles are mainly known to those who are interested in working
openly anyway. Fostering (facets of) Open Science should not only be
a case of "preaching to the converted", but to give anybody an
understanding of the concepts, principles, opportunities and challenges
of the related subjects.

### Aim

There are quite a number of approaches how this can be undertaken and
a number of projects doing this for either certain topics or certain
target groups. However, there does not seem to be a concerted approach.

This compendium aims to include documentation of the [different facets of Open Science](https://github.com/aleimba/Facettes_of_Open_Science/blob/master/facettes_of_open_science.png)
like Open Access, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Peer Review
(see Facettes of Open Science). Our definition of Open Science is very
broad - it also covers the opening of the humanities as well as
Open Educational Resources and other related topics.

**"Open Science 101" is the current working title and might be changed
in the future dependent on the actual content.**

### Current Status

**Current Status: IN PREPARATION**

Currently we are [collecting ideas](https://github.com/OKScienceDE/Open_Science_101/issues)
about the scope via the issue tracker and would invite everybody to
contribute to the discussion and to share ideas.

Our role models for this repository are Software Carpentry (http://software-carpentry.org/)
and Data Carpentry (http://www.datacarpentry.org/). Both initiatives host
all their teaching material public in GitHub repositories so the content
can be easily crowd-sourced (see e.g. http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/).
We will try to adhere to their style as far as this is suitable.

We are aware that this is not the first attempt to generate such a
collection but in our opinion there is no comprehensive resource
covering all the required topics.

### Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016 (2nd - 3rd June, 2016)

At the upcoming [Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint 2016](https://www.mozillascience.org/global-sprint-2016)
-- an event with local and virtual meetings -- we will work on the
compendium. Again, you are invited to join us (which you can announce here:
